## Our Goal
The objective of this tutorial is to learn how to incorporate Firebase into our Flutter apps. We'll be using Firebase Cloud Firestore as well as the Firebase authentication package to equip our app with a cloud-based NoSQL database and secure authentication methods. 


## What you will create

We’re going to build a modern messaging app where users can sign up and log in to chat.
